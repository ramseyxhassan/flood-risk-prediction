# Flood Risk Prediction for Property Owners

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive flood risk prediction model for property owners in Baltimore County. The aim is to integrate geospatial analysis with environmental data to accurately assess flood risks, providing valuable insights for property owners.

## Files in the Project
- `BMC_Dataset_merged_with_FPD_nearest_geom_and_flood_probability.ipynb` - Notebook merging BMC datasets with Flood Probability Data and nearest geometry calculations.
- `bmc_property_assessments_final.ipynb` - Notebook processing the Baltimore County property assessments.
- `expected_loss.ipynb` - Analysis notebook calculating the expected loss due to flooding.
- `Model_Enhancement.ipynb` - Notebook dedicated to enhancing and refining the predictive model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Geopandas, Rasterio, CatBoost, etc.
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data exploration and visualization.

## Methodology
The project employs a series of Jupyter Notebooks to process and analyze data. Key steps include:
1. Merging property assessments with flood probability data.
2. Utilizing spatial analysis for risk calculation.
3. Developing a predictive model using machine learning techniques.
4. Visualizing and communicating the results effectively.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with necessary Python libraries.
3. Run the notebooks in sequence to understand the data processing, analysis, and model development steps.
